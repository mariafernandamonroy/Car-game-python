# Car-game-python
## Description ##
This project is a solution for the console car game problem. Made on Python language using POO and database connection.
## Console car game problem ##
In this game you create some cars that are positioned on a track (each car has a driver), there can be as many cars as lanes, each track must have the same distance limit (kilometers) for the travel of the car, the cars advance randomly increasing their distance by meters (the kilometers must be converted to meters so that the advance is in meters). 
For each advance there must be a die (from 1 to 6) that allows the cart to move and must be multiplied by 100, for example if the die is rolled and you roll 5 then it should be 5*100 = 500 meters of travel.
## Database configuration ##
I connect the application with MongoDB. First, I create a free cluster on https://www.mongodb.com/ and I connected with MongoDB compass software. Then I modified the database file to connect with my database. (More info in https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster/). After this configuration I can use the database and see it on MongoDB Compass.
